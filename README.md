# CSE-323-Operating_Systems_Design-Distance_measure_with_led_alarm
It's a simple Arduino Based Project of CSE-323 (Operating Systems Design) course what is able to calculate the distance of an object and also make an alarm with led.


## Introduction :
In this project we works with Arduino. Here we build a device what is able to calculate a distance
of an object with LED and alarm. When an object is near to the device it gives us a LED signal
with alarm .Distance is shown in serial monitor of arduino. After that when that object is in another
distance then there will be a change of LED light and alarm. That means we will get different LED
signals with different alarm tones for different distances .Three different LED and alarm tone
works here. Finally when the object isnâ€™t near to the device and not in the range what was declared
in our code then serial monitor show that object is Out of Range and there will be no LED light
signal with no alarm.
